# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to understand the differences in ride-share data amoung urban, suburban and rural cities. By plotting a multiple line graph from a dataseries, we were able to discern various breakouts of data, including average fare per driver, average fare per ride, and total rides, drivers and fares. Ultimiately this data will be used to help PyBer, a ride sharing company, make more informed decisions regarding the future of their business. 

## Results

There is quite the discrenpancy among ride-sharing data between different kinds of cities. It is no surprose that urban areas bring in the most rides, drivers and total fare amount. However, its interesting to note that drivers are paid less, on average, in an urban area compared to both suburban and rural. The chart below highlights these discrepancies:

This chart also highlights the higher the fare, the more the driver is paid. We can see that if one wanted to be a ride-share driver, it would make the most sense for them to work in a rural area - they make more money and drive less!


Our multiple line chart, depicted below, gives us some insight into trends over time.

It's interesting to note that April 1st is a great time for rural drivers - fares spike, which means drivers make more. However, suburban drivers might not have such luck - their fares will only increase mid-month. Urban drivers might see an intense increase right before the turn of the month. Across all three city types, late February  is a great time to drive. ALl three fare amounts spike simultanously. 


## Summary

Based on the results above, here are three business recommendations for the CEO of PyBer.

1. Capitalize on promos during the more expensive parts of the year for the other ride-sharing companies. Incentives for cheaper rides when the competition is hanging around the same benchmark will inspire people to switch to your brand.

2. Understand why there are unanimous spikes during certain times of the year - are they popular vacation weeks? Are many people traveling? Is it school break? Understanding how the public is using the ride-sharing app industry can provide companies like PyBer opportunities to do something new.

3. Provide higher wages for urban city drivers. If the CEO of PyBer can guanrantee that you will make more money than the average urban driver, you will attract more empoloyees which means more business!!
